This document clarifies the conceptual history and attribution for the SkillForge Prime platform (repository name: Skillforge_prime).

## 1. Conceptual Origin and Inspiration

The high-level vision, conceptual architecture, and product goals for an AI-powered adaptive educational platform were directly inspired by the initial work of the **Athenos** project.

* **Original Project Name:** Athenos
* **Original Repository:** Original - https://github.com/epiGnosko/Athenos
                           The appropriated - https://github.com/DevFestHackathon2025/Athenos-Next

* **Original License:** MIT License

We acknowledge and respect the foundation laid by the original creator(s) in publishing this work, which served as a valuable inspiration for our own project's direction.

## 2. Codebase Status (Clean-Room Implementation)

The entire codebase for **Talosopolis (Skillforge_prime)** is an original, **100% clean-room implementation** and rewrite developed by The Promethean Society.

* **Technology Stack:** Our current codebase uses a modern Next.js/TypeScript/JavaScript stack.
* **No Code Reuse:** No code, files, or specific non-functional structures were copied, modified, or merged from the original Python/Flask-based Athenos project or any intermediate projects (e.g., Athenos-Next).
* **Copyright Separation:** The copyright in the code of this repository belongs entirely to The Promethean Society.

## 3. Name Separation

Our current project name, **SkillForge Prime**, has been chosen to eliminate any potential confusion in the marketplace with the original "Athenos" project name or any derivative names (like the deprecated "Athenos-Next", "Talos", "Talosopolis", etc...).

This statement serves as a formal, good-faith attribution and clarification of the distinct nature of the underlying code base.
