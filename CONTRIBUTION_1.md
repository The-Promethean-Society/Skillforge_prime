Skillforge Prime Contributor Rewards and Attribution Policy

This document outlines the policy governing attribution, recognition, and compensation for all external contributors to the Skillforge Prime Monorepo.

Our goal is to build a vibrant, collaborative, and decentralized project where contributions are directly rewarded.

1. Attribution and Recognition

All contributions, regardless of size, are governed by the MIT License, which ensures you retain copyright over your work while granting the project usage rights.

Commit History: All contributors will receive permanent attribution via the Git commit history and the Pull Request merge log.

Contributor List: All contributors who merge at least one Pull Request will be permanently listed in the project’s main README.md and/or on a dedicated Contributor page.

Intellectual Property (IP): Contributors retain their IP rights, and all code is open. Our system is built on recognizing individual expertise (Skills Graph) and contributions (Karmic Alignment), tying directly into your developer persona.

2. Contributor Compensation (Incentivized Model)

The Skillforge Prime project operates on an incentivized model. While compensation is not a legal guarantee under the MIT license, we utilize a transparent, merit-based system to reward value. (See CONTRIBUTIONS.md)

A. Bounty and Token Rewards

We operate a community bounty system tied to the underlying decentralized infrastructure (e.g., Filecoin/Blockchain technologies mentioned in the architecture).

Reward Type

Criteria

Payment Mechanism

Critical Bug Fix

Fixes a security vulnerability or critical application crash.

Paid immediately via a cryptocurrency reward (e.g., Filecoin-backed token) upon merge.

Feature Completion (CBE)

Successfully completes a clearly defined Competency-Building Event (CBE) feature marked with the bounty:X-tokens label.

Paid upon successful E2E test verification and merge.

Documentation/Triage

Substantial improvements to documentation or consistent, high-quality issue triage.

Awarded quarterly based on core team review.

B. In-Game (Skillforge Realm) Compensation

For contributions to the codebase, we also grant non-transferable in-game rewards that enhance a developer's persona:

Legendary Badges: Unique contributor badges tied to the user's Skills Graph and Co-Curricular Transcript.

Karmic Alignment Boost: Significant positive boosts to the developer's Karmic Alignment score, which grants access to advanced GM tools and mentoring roles within the Skillforge Realm.

3. Contribution Guidelines

To ensure eligibility for rewards and smooth integration into the monorepo, all contributors must:

Sign the simple Contributor License Agreement (CLA) (to be provided via a third-party service like CLA assistant).

Adhere to the Monorepo Path Filtering structure defined in auto-assign.yml.

Ensure all code passes the automated ci-build status checks.
